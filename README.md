Instructions for use

Once the program is initiated, the GUI home page will appear, prompting the user with the optionality of going to the TA servers or the pages I've created. All links are denoted by blue, and all page text is denoted by black. By clicking the Back button, a user is able to return to the previous page (unless a user is on the home page of Guizilla). A user can enter a URL in the address bar and press the submit button (to the right of the address bar) to navigate to a desired page. By clicking the Quit button, a user terminates the program.

By clicking a link, the program will navigate the user to a new page. A page can contain page text, links, and forms. By navigating to a form, a user can enter a text input and/or submit that form presented on the page by clicking the Submit
button located below the text input. By clicking the Back button, a user can return to that form with their previous inputs still there. These action events can be used for navigation and interactivity.

The correct syntax for a URL is either "http://hostname/path" or just "/path" if a user has already connected to a server.
